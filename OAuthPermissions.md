# Square Platform API OAuth Scopes

The Square Platform API requires OAuth scopes with every call to an
endpoint.  [OAuth: Permissions Reference](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/square-permissions)
provided all needed permissions (scopes) for each endpoint.

Change the SCOPES in the request URL of your example app to broaden or limit the access token you receive.
